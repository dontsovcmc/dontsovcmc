### Hi! 👋

Create code, photos, design, impressions and dreams.

I'm an proactive programmer, opensource enthusiast, photographer, travel lover.

I know how to work under uncertain conditions, but I like order. I know about "the client's world". I like to do things that others have failed to do. It is important for me to believe in the product I develop.

I can solve problems in a range from proof of concept till writing drivers and assembling electronic equipment.
